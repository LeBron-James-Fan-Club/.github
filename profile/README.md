## The LBJFC

Welcome to the most electrifying, gravity-defying, championship-slaying, taco-Tuesday-celebrating group of LeBron stans this side of Akron! If you think LeBron is the GOAT, and you can dunk on anyone who dares mention a "Jordan vs. LeBron" debate in 2024, then welcome home. üåÆüëë

Our motto? "LeBron is my sunshine, my only sunshine. He makes me happy when the Cavs/Heat/Lakers skies are gray." And yes, even when he switches teams, our sunshine remains strong and blinding. üåû

From The Block to The Decision, we‚Äôre here for every highlight, every meme, and every Taco Tuesday shoutout. If you‚Äôre not ready to sing ‚ÄúYou are my sunshine‚Äù while watching 2016 Finals Game 7 on repeat, you're in the wrong place, buddy.

Bronsexuals unite!
